# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINE
### These are the basic contribution guidelines for the project.

I am not all *that* picky about how this project evolves, I have a simple policy/goal with this project;
> Don't complicate it too much, but make the most performant kernel we can, without breaking generic support.
> I'm looking for patches that can be applied on a generic scale, something that will benefit everyone, 
> not just specific hardware.
> Possibly adding in a structure for adding specific patches for custom hardware, things like Steamdeck
> patches, Android device support, Microsoft Surface devices, etc etc.

All in all, the goal is to keep the user in control of their kernel. We will provide them with a nice
baseline to start with, with kernel debugging (mostly) disable as it should be in a production level kernel,
small tweaks to what compression algorithms the kernel/initramfs use to aim for speed during boot,
switching the zswap/zram compression algorithims to take advantage of multi-core CPU's,
removing support for CAN bus and HAM radio hardware for desktop PC kernels, this list goes on and on.

The main contribution to this project is to simply run it. If you can run this kernel on more hardware
this will help us to debug any issues that may arise from our tunings, and we can address them.


### Contribute Your Kernel Module Data

Want to help improve hardware coverage for the TꓘT project? You can contribute your system’s kernel module data using one of two preferred methods.
## Quick Overview
# Option 1: lsmod (quick + easy)

`lsmod | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}' | sort -u > ~/Desktop/$(hostname)-TKT-modules-list.txt`

# Option 2: modprobed-db (thorough + preferred)

All the detailed steps—including how to install and set up modprobed-db, generate your module list, and submit a pull request—are now maintained in the dedicated contribution guide here:
[ETJAKEOC/modprobed.db](https://github.com/ETJAKEOC/modprobed.db)

## Goals

Below is a checklist of platform-specific compile goals for this project. These represent both completed and planned features, and will help contributors and users see where the project is headed.

```
- [ ] **Work on patches:** For all kernel versions, bring in more from other providers.
- [ ] **Gentoo (OpenRC):** Complete GHCI build and patch set.
- [ ] **Gentoo (SystemD):** Complete GHCI build and patch set.
- [ ] **Pop!_OS:** Complete GHCI build and patch set.
```
